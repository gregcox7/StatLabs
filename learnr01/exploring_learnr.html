<p>In this session, we will learn a bit about data and how to explore it
using R. The point is to learn a bit more about data and variables and
to get a feel for the power of the tools we will be learning to use in
the rest of the semester.</p>
<p>As you follow along in this activity, you will be asked to run bits
of code in RStudio. The code will appear in special boxes, like the one
below. The code in the box below will add the numbers 2 and 3. When you
run it, the result will appear directly below the box.</p>

</div>
<p>Another point of today’s activity is to illustrate how even though
statistics is about dealing with data, those data are
<em>meaningful</em>. They are not just numbers or names, they are a peek
into the world. They offer glimpses of someone’s life, of the workings
of some natural process, of some social structure, etc. Any dataset will
be limited in how wide of a glimpse it gives us, and the point of
statistics is how to learn and make decisions based on that glimpse.</p>
<div id="section-r-and-rstudio" class="section level2">
<h2>R and RStudio</h2>
<p>All of our labs will make use of RStudio, a graphical interface to
the statistical computing language R. The R language represents the
current state of the art for statistical computing in both academic and
industrial research. It is likely to remain relevant for many years to
come because it is free and open-source, meaning both that it is widely
accessible and that improvements and extensions are being made
continuously by a large community of professionals and hobbyists. In
fact, many of the best features of R that we will be using are
extensions made by people outside the “core” development team for R.
These extensions are called “packages”, and they represent bundles of
code that are useful for doing statistics.</p>
<p>RStudio is an interface that makes it easier to work with the R
language, and it is also free and can be installed on computers running
any modern operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.). R and RStudio
are both already installed on the computers in our classroom, as well as
those in other Technology-Enhanced Classrooms and the Library Public
Computing Sites on campus. If you are working on your own computer, you
will have an easier time of it if you install RStudio on it. Installing
RStudio requires installing R first.</p>
<div id="section-installation-on-your-own-computer"
class="section level3">
<h3>Installation on your own computer</h3>
<p>You can <strong>install R</strong> on your own computer by following
the instructions here: <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/"
class="uri">https://cran.rstudio.com/</a></p>
<p>After installing R, you can install <strong>RStudio Desktop</strong>
by following the instructions here: <a
href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/"
class="uri">https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a></p>
</div>
<div id="section-running-r-in-a-browser" class="section level3">
<h3>Running R in a browser</h3>
<p>Even if you don’t have access to a computer with RStudio installed
locally, you can use it if you have access to the internet. You can run
RStudio online here: <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/"
class="uri">https://rstudio.cloud/</a>. The downside with this is that
there is a cap to the amount of time you can spend using the online
version, so you are better off using a local installation whenever
possible. You may need to create an account to use the online version,
but it is free to do so.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-required-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Required packages</h2>
<p>Once you have RStudio up and running, run the line of code in the
grey box below by copying it and pasting it after the “&gt;” in the
“Console” in the lower left pane of the RStudio window.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.1 ──</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ✔ ggplot2 3.3.6     ✔ purrr   0.3.4
## ✔ tibble  3.1.8     ✔ dplyr   1.0.9
## ✔ tidyr   1.1.3     ✔ stringr 1.4.0
## ✔ readr   2.1.2     ✔ forcats 0.5.1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()</code></pre>
<p>If you are working on a computer on campus, you should see some
messages similar to the ones shown above. These messages tell us that R
has loaded some helpful “packages” from its “library” that we will use.
You may notice some messages about “conflicts”, but these are nothing we
need to worry about.</p>
<p>If you are working on your own computer or on the online version of
RStudio, you might have gotten an error when you tried to run that last
line. If you did get an error, run the following line to install the
“tidyverse” package that we will need for this course.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Installing the “tidyverse” package takes a while, but you’ll only
need to do it once. After it is installed, you can just run
<code>library(tidyverse)</code> when you start RStudio and have
everything you need.</p>
<div id="section-troubleshooting-tip" class="section level3">
<h3>Troubleshooting tip</h3>
<p>Because the “tidyverse” package is not automatically loaded when you
first start RStudio, you should make sure to run the line</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>first thing each time you open RStudio. Chances are, if you try
running something and you get an error, it is because the “tidyverse”
package is not loaded. Of course, that’s not the only possible thing
that can cause an error! But it’s good to try this first to see if it
clears things up.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-meet-your-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Meet your data</h2>
<p>The data we will be looking at are passenger records from the RMS
<em>Titanic</em>, an oceanliner which famously sank on April 15, 1912.
Though the liner was not filled to capacity, lax safety
precautions—including a failure to carry enough lifeboats—meant that
many of her passengers died because they were unable to evacuate when
the ship struck an iceberg.</p>
<div id="section-load-the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Load the data</h3>
<p>Run the following line of code at the console to load our data into
your RStudio “environment”:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregcox7/StatLabs/main/data/titanic.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 1309 Columns: 11── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot;
## chr (7): residence, sex, name, ticket, cabin, embarked, hometown
## dbl (3): class, age, fare
## lgl (1): survived
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.</code></pre>
<p>You should now see “titanic” pop up in the upper right hand pane of
the RStudio window. Click on “titanic” in the upper right to take a look
at the data.</p>

<div id="section-check-out-the-variables" class="section level3">
<h3>Check out the variables</h3>
<p>This is what RStudio looks like (with some helpful colored

<p><img src="../img/rstudio_window.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>In the upper left of the RStudio screen, you’ll see a bunch of
columns. These are our data in “raw” form. Each row represents a
specific passenger (“case”) and each column represents a different

<div id="section-answering-questions-with-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Answering questions with data</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve gotten acquainted with the kind of data we have, we
can begin using it to answer some questions. This will involve
simplifying the data, turning it into a summary form that makes it
easier to understand. These summaries fall under the heading of
“descriptive statistics”, because they are meant to <em>describe</em>
important aspects of the data. The four types of summaries we will
explore today are <strong>frequency tables</strong>,
<strong>proportions</strong>, <strong>bar charts</strong>, and
<strong>histograms</strong>. The questions we will attempt to answer are
all about <em>who</em> survived and <em>who</em> perished on the
<em>Titanic</em>.</p>
<div id="section-frequency-tables" class="section level3">
<h3>Frequency tables</h3>
<p>One way we could answer literally the question, “who survived and who
died on the <em>Titanic</em>?” would be to read the names of each of the
1300 or so passengers in our dataset. The problem is that this would not
give us much of a sense of <em>why</em> particular people might have
survived versus not. Treating survival as a <strong>response
variable</strong>, we would like to treat other variables in these data
as <strong>explanatory variables</strong>. This gives us a sense of the
<em>types</em> of people who were more or less likely to have survived,
and what this tells us about the <em>Titanic</em> disaster as a
whole.</p>
<p>To begin, the first thing we can do as construct a <strong>frequency
table</strong> that simply counts the number of people who survived and
the number of people who died. This summary will give us a sense of the
scale of the disaster. In the RStudio window, see the big open space
just below our data? This is called the “console” and is where we will
do most of our work. Copy and paste the code below into the “Console”.
The code should appear right after the “&gt;”. Once it is there, hit
<strong>enter</strong> to run it and see the results.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  group_by(survived) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n())</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["survived"],"name":[1],"type":["lgl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["n"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"FALSE","2":"809"},{"1":"TRUE","2":"500"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>We got a table that counted the number of people who did and did not
survive. We went from 1300 or so rows with multiple variables each to
just two numbers. A pretty concise summary! But how did we do it? Let’s
break down that bit of code:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>titanic</code> is the name of our dataset.</li>
<li><code>group_by(survived)</code> tells R to group the cases in that
dataset by whether they survived (<code>TRUE</code>) or not
(<code>FALSE</code>).</li>
<li><code>summarize(n=n())</code> tells R to take our grouped cases and
<em>summarize</em> them by counting the <code>n</code>umber of people in
each group and labeling the resulting number “<code>n</code>”.</li>
<li>The funky symbol <code>%&gt;%</code> connects the three steps above
and makes sure R does them in the order we want. This symbol is called a
“pipe”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s try a few things to get a sense of why that code did what it
did. What happens if we change <code>n = n()</code> in the last line to
<code>Number = n()</code>?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  group_by(survived) %&gt;%
  summarize(Number = n())</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["survived"],"name":[1],"type":["lgl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["Number"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"FALSE","2":"809"},{"1":"TRUE","2":"500"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>Everything looks the same except that instead of the column being
labeled “n”, it is labeled “Number”. So the bit before the equals sign
is how the frequency table will be labeled.</p>
<p>Now let’s try something that seems like a small change: Instead of
<code>n = n()</code> in the last line, let’s write <code>n = m()</code>.
Only one letter, surely it can’t be that big of a difference?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  group_by(survived) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = m())</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Error in `summarize()`:
## ! Problem while computing `n = m()`.
## ℹ The error occurred in group 1: survived = FALSE.
## Caused by error in `m()`:
## ! could not find function &quot;m&quot;</code></pre>
<p>R doesn’t like it! It reports an error because it doesn’t know what
to do with <code>m()</code>. That’s because <code>n()</code> is a
<strong>function</strong>, it is an instruction that tells R to count
the <code>n</code>umber of something. On the other hand,
<code>m()</code> doesn’t mean anything to R so it throws up its
hands.</p>
<p>We can also get counts based on other variables. For example, let’s
ask how many passengers there were in each “class” by changing the
grouping variable in our code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  group_by(class) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n())</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["class"],"name":[1],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["n"],"name":[2],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"1","2":"323"},{"1":"2","2":"277"},{"1":"3","2":"709"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Try running the chunk of code below which was written to count the
number of passengers with or without college degrees:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  group_by(degree) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n())</code></pre>
<p>Explain in your own words why this chunk of code does not work.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, let’s construct a frequency table using multiple variables.
This lets us answer more complex questions like, <strong>how many
British women were aboard the <em>Titanic</em></strong>? That question
involves two variables, <code>residence</code> (where people were from)
and <code>sex</code> (whether classified as male or female). We can put
both of those variables in the <code>group_by</code> line to find our
answer.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  group_by(residence, sex) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n())</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;residence&#39;. You can override using the
## `.groups` argument.</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["residence"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["sex"],"name":[2],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["n"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"American","2":"Female","3":"108"},{"1":"American","2":"Male","3":"150"},{"1":"British","2":"Female","3":"94"},{"1":"British","2":"Male","3":"208"},{"1":"Other","2":"Female","3":"264"},{"1":"Other","2":"Male","3":"485"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-titanic-props" class="section level3">
<h3>Proportions</h3>
<p>You may have heard that, when trying to evacuate the
<em>Titanic</em>, there was a rule to put “women and children first”
onto lifeboats. This suggests a <strong>hypothesis</strong>, assuming
this rule was actually followed: female passengers should have survived
more often than male passengers.</p>
<p>To see if the data are consistent with this hypothesis, we can begin
by using code similar to what we’ve been using to count the number of
male and female passengers who either did or did not survive.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  group_by(sex, survived) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n())</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;sex&#39;. You can override using the `.groups`
## argument.</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sex"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["survived"],"name":[2],"type":["lgl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["n"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Female","2":"FALSE","3":"127"},{"1":"Female","2":"TRUE","3":"339"},{"1":"Male","2":"FALSE","3":"682"},{"1":"Male","2":"TRUE","3":"161"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>While this table contains all the information we need to test this
hypothesis, it is hard to read because there were different numbers of
male and female passengers. What we want to know is whether a greater
<em>proportion</em> of female passengers survived, compared to the
<em>proportion</em> of male passengers who survived.</p>
<p>We find proportions by taking a count and dividing by a sum of
counts. Specifically, if we have some group “A” and want to find the
proportion of the elements in group “A” that have some characteristic
“B”, we find</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Proportion of A that are B} = \frac{\text{Number of A that are
B}}{\text{Total number of A&#39;s}}
\]</span></p>
<div id="section-r-is-a-fancy-calculator" class="section level4">
<h4>R is a fancy calculator</h4>
<p>Let’s use the numbers in the frequency table above to find the
proportion of male passengers who survived and the proportion of female
passengers who survived. This will illustrate how, although R is quite
powerful, it is in many ways just a fancy calculator. But a calculator
is still handy!</p>
<p>From the table we just made, we see that 339 female passengers
survived. There are <span class="math inline">\(339 + 127\)</span> total
female passengers. So we can use R to find the <em>proportion</em> of
female passengers who survived using the line of code below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>339 / (339 + 127)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.7274678</code></pre>
<p>Notice that <code>/</code> stands for “division” and we put <span
class="math inline">\(339 + 127\)</span> in <em>parentheses</em> to tell
R that that whole sum should be in the denominator.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Find the proportion of <em>male</em> passengers who survived
(<em>Hint: the numbers you need come from the same table that showed the
number of female passengers who did and did not survive.</em>). Compare
the proportion of survivors among male and female passengers—are these
proportions consistent with the “women and children first” policy?
Explain your reasoning.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-another-way-to-get-proportions" class="section level4">
<h4>Another way to get proportions</h4>
<p>One thing you will notice with R is that there are many ways to do
the same thing. Instead of calculating proportions by hand, we can add a
line to the code we used to make the frequency table before to get R to
give us the proportions of female and male passengers who did and did
not survive:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  group_by(sex, survived) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;sex&#39;. You can override using the `.groups`
## argument.</code></pre>
<div data-pagedtable="false">
<script data-pagedtable-source type="application/json">
{"columns":[{"label":["sex"],"name":[1],"type":["chr"],"align":["left"]},{"label":["survived"],"name":[2],"type":["lgl"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["n"],"name":[3],"type":["int"],"align":["right"]},{"label":["p"],"name":[4],"type":["dbl"],"align":["right"]}],"data":[{"1":"Female","2":"FALSE","3":"127","4":"0.2725322"},{"1":"Female","2":"TRUE","3":"339","4":"0.7274678"},{"1":"Male","2":"FALSE","3":"682","4":"0.8090154"},{"1":"Male","2":"TRUE","3":"161","4":"0.1909846"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
  </script>
</div>
<p>The new column <code>p</code> is a proportion and represents the
proportion of people in each group (either male or female) who either
did or did not survive. Notice that the numbers in the <code>p</code>
column for male and female survivors are the same as the ones we found
in the preceding section.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Write and run code that gives us a table, like the one above, which
shows the proportion of people in each class (1, 2, or 3) who survived
or died. Again, you will find it helpful to start from code we already
used and try filling in the blanks:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  group_by(___, survived) %&gt;%
  summarize(n = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(p = n / sum(n))</code></pre>
<p>What code did you use? Which Class had the highest proportion of
survivors?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-titanic-bar" class="section level3">
<h3>Bar charts</h3>
<p>If we are looking for patterns or trends in data, it is often easier
to see them with a visualization rather than a table of numbers. Bar
charts make numerical relationships easy to see visually, so we don’t
need to compare a bunch of numbers.</p>
<p>For example, above we made a table to count the number of passengers
in each class. A bar chart conveys the same information in terms of the
height of the bars.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar()</code></pre>
<p><img src="exploring_learnr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Pretty neat! It is now easy to see how many more 3rd class passengers
there were than 1st or 2nd, and that interestingly, there are fewer 2nd
class than 1st class passengers.</p>
<p>The code we used is similar to what we’ve been using, but differs in
some important ways: * The first line is the same, telling R what
dataset we are using (<code>titanic</code>). * The second line tells R
that we want to make a <code>plot</code> and that we want to put the
variable <code>class</code> along the horizontal axis of that plot (the
<code>x</code> axis). The “gg” in front of “plot” refers to the
“<strong>g</strong>rammar of <strong>g</strong>raphics”, which is the
language R uses to describe plots. In this language, different parts of
a plot are called “<strong>aes</strong>thetics”, which is why
<code>x = class</code> falls inside a parenthetical labeled
<code>aes</code>(thetic). * The final line just tells R that we want to
make a <code>bar</code> chart. In the grammar of graphics, different
types of charts are called <code>geom</code>s. * Notice that the second
2 lines are connected by a <code>+</code> rather than the
<code>%&gt;%</code> symbol. This is a historical accident, but the
meaning of the two symbols is basically the same. Both of them are
telling R the order in which it should follow our instructions.</p>
<p>If we put bar charts side-by-side, we can use them to compare groups.
In R, putting multiple graphs together is called
<strong>faceting</strong>. Each graph is a “facet”. We can tell R to
make facets based on a specific variable by adding a line to our code,
like so:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = class)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(&quot;residence&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="exploring_learnr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>The line at the end splits the plot into different “facets”, one for
each level of the <code>residence</code> variable. Note that we have to
put the “faceting” variable name in quotes (for some reason). The result
makes it easy to see that the distribution of passengers across classes
is different depending on where they were from—Americans on the
<em>Titanic</em> tended to be wealthier first class passengers, relative
to passengers from Britain or elsewhere.</p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Make a bar chart that shows the number of people who either did or
did not survive depending on their country of residence. To do this,
fill in the blanks in the code below so that each “facet” corresponds to
country of residence and each “facet” has two bars in it, one bar for
survivors and one bar for non-survivors.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = ___)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(&quot;___&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>What code did you use? What is a possible reason why the relative
number of survivors is different depending on where passengers were
from?</p>

<p>So far, we have been summarizing <em>categorical</em> variables.
There are also some numerical variables in our data, for example the age
of each passenger as well as how much they paid for their tickets. Let’s
try making a frequency table to figure out how many people of different
ages sailed on the <em>Titanic</em>:</p>

<p>Well that’s not very helpful! R didn’t even bother to show us the
whole thing. Though we can see something interesting: Age is measured in
years, and for passengers at least one year old, their age is a whole
number. But there are fractions of years for passengers less than a year
old—these ages were <em>measured</em> in months rather than years.</p>
<p>The main point is that even though age can be measured in a more or
less fine-grained manner, age is effectively <em>continuous</em>. We
don’t want to know how many passengers were exactly 31.3491 years old,
we want to get a general sense of the <em>distribution</em> of ages
across passengers.</p>
<p>We can construct a summary that conveys this information using a
<strong>histogram</strong>. A histogram is very similar to a bar chart;
the difference is that bar charts are for categorical variables while
histograms are for numerical variables. The code below constructs a
histogram to summarize passenger age:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 263 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).</code></pre>
<p><img src="exploring_learnr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>The resulting histogram shows a bunch of bars, the height of which
indicate the number of passengers within a particular age range. Notice
that we got a couple messages from R in addition to our plot, one about
“non-finite values” and another about “picking a better value”. When R
says, “non-finite values”, it is talking about people for whom their age
was not recorded. This is an unfortunate thing about real data:
sometimes it has missing pieces. This didn’t stop R from making the plot
we wanted using the non-missing data, but R wanted to warn us just in
case.</p>
<p>The message about “picking a better value” is important: When you
make a histogram, you are looking at how many things fall within a
particular range of values, say, between ages 4 and 8. How do you decide
those ranges? If you don’t tell R how to do that, it will decide on its
own to divide up the range of values into 30 “bins”, each of which
corresponds to a range of values that is the same width. This is usually
not what we want.</p>
<p>Instead, we should decide how big or small we want those ranges to
be. The following code tells R to make our histogram using “bins” that
are 2 years “wide” (0-1, 2-3, etc.):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 263 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).</code></pre>
<p><img src="exploring_learnr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>And just like we did with bar charts, we can split a histogram into
different “facets”. The pair of histograms below shows the distribution
of ages of passengers that either did or did not survive:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2) +
  facet_wrap(&quot;survived&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Removed 263 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).</code></pre>
<p><img src="exploring_learnr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<div class="exercise">
<p>Try making several different histograms of passenger age split by
survival, using different bin widths:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>titanic %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = ___) +
  facet_wrap(&quot;survived&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>What bin width do you believe gives the best visual summary and why?
Describe whether the shapes of the histograms in each facet are
consistent with the “women and <em>children</em> first” rule.</p>

<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>Today we began our adventure by using RStudio to explore some data.
We saw how to look at data and how to summarize it in various helpful
ways. These were frequency tables, proportions, bar charts, and
histograms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequency tables count the number of times a particular value of a
particular variable (or combination of values across multiple variables)
occurs in our dataset.</li>
<li>We can use the counts in frequency tables to calculate proportions,
which are better at conveying relative values.</li>
<li>Bar charts display counts of categorical variables in a visual form
that makes it easier to compare them.</li>
<li>Histograms let us visually summarize counts of numerical variables
by putting them in “bins”, the width of which we need to decide.
