<p>In this session, we will learn a bit about data and how to explore it using R/RStudio. The point is to learn a bit more about data and variables and to get a feel for the power of the tools we will be learning to use in the rest of the semester.</p>
<p>As you follow along in this activity, you will be asked to run bits of code in RStudio. This code can be copied-and-pasted into the “Console” at the lower left of RStudio. You will also be asked to modify code and run it yourself, which again you can do by typing your code into the console.</p>
<p>When the document shows you a snippet of code, it also shows typical R output that should result from running that code. For example, the following snippet of code adds two numbers; the way R prints the result is shown below the snippet of code.</p>

<p>Another point of today’s activity is to illustrate how even though statistics is about dealing with data, those data are <em>meaningful</em>. They are not just numbers or names, they are a peek into the world. They offer glimpses of someone’s life, of the workings of some natural process, of some social structure, etc. Any dataset will be limited in how wide of a glimpse it gives us, and the point of statistics is how to learn and make decisions based on that glimpse.</p>

</h2>
<p>All of our labs will make use of RStudio, a graphical interface to the statistical computing language R. The R language represents the current state of the art for statistical computing in both academic and industrial research. It is likely to remain relevant for many years to come because it is free and open-source, meaning both that it is widely accessible and that improvements and extensions are being made continuously by a large community of professionals and hobbyists. In fact, many of the best features of R that we will be using are extensions made by people outside the “core” development team for R. These extensions are called “packages,” and they represent bundles of code that are useful for doing statistics.</p>
<p>RStudio is an interface that makes it easier to work with the R language, and it is also free and can be installed on computers running any modern operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.). R and RStudio are both already installed on the computers in our classroom, as well as those in other Technology-Enhanced Classrooms and the Library Public Computing Sites on campus. If you are working on your own computer, you will have an easier time of it if you install RStudio on it. Installing RStudio requires installing R first.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t have access to a computer with RStudio installed locally, you can use it if you have access to the internet. You can run RStudio online here: <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/" class="uri">https://rstudio.cloud/</a>. The downside with this is that there is a cap to the amount of time you can spend using the online version, so you are better off using a local installation whenever possible. You may need to create an account to use the online version, but it is free to do so.</p>

<p>If you are working on a computer on campus, you should see some messages similar to the ones shown above. These messages tell us that R has loaded some helpful “packages” from its “library” that we will use. You may notice some messages about “conflicts,” but these are nothing we need to worry about.</p>
<p>If you are working on your own computer or on the online version of RStudio, you might have gotten an error when you tried to run that last line. If you did get an error, run the following line to install the “tidyverse” package that we will need for this course.</p>

<p>Installing the “tidyverse” package takes a while, but you’ll only need to do it once. After it is installed, you can just run <code><a href="https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org">library(tidyverse)</a></code> when you start RStudio and have everything you need.</p>

<p>Because the “tidyverse” package is not automatically loaded when you first start RStudio, you should make sure to run the line</p>

<p>first thing each time you open RStudio. Chances are, if you try running something and you get an error, it is because the “tidyverse” package is not loaded. Of course, that’s not the only possible thing that can cause an error! But it’s good to try this first to see if it clears things up.</p>

<p>The data we will be looking at are passenger records from the RMS <em>Titanic</em>, an oceanliner which famously sank on April 15, 1912. Though the liner was not filled to capacity, lax safety precautions—including a failure to carry enough lifeboats—meant that many of her passengers died because they were unable to evacuate when the ship struck an iceberg.</p>

<p>Now that we’ve gotten acquainted with the kind of data we have, we can begin using it to answer some questions. This will involve simplifying the data, turning it into a summary form that makes it easier to understand. These summaries fall under the heading of “descriptive statistics,” because they are meant to <em>describe</em> important aspects of the data. The four types of summaries we will explore today are <strong>frequency tables</strong>, <strong>proportions</strong>, <strong>bar charts</strong>, and <strong>histograms</strong>. The questions we will attempt to answer are all about <em>who</em> survived and <em>who</em> perished on the <em>Titanic</em>.</p>
<div id="frequency-tables" class="section level3" number="1.4.1">

<span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Frequency tables<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#frequency-tables"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>One way we could answer literally the question, “who survived and who died on the <em>Titanic</em>?” would be to read the names of each of the 1300 or so passengers in our dataset. The problem is that this would not give us much of a sense of <em>why</em> particular people might have survived versus not. Treating survival as a <strong>response variable</strong>, we would like to treat other variables in these data as <strong>explanatory variables</strong>. This gives us a sense of the <em>types</em> of people who were more or less likely to have survived, and what this tells us about the <em>Titanic</em> disaster as a whole.</p>
<p>To begin, the first thing we can do as construct a <strong>frequency table</strong> that simply counts the number of people who survived and the number of people who died. This summary will give us a sense of the scale of the disaster. In the RStudio window, see the big open space just below our data? This is called the “console” and is where we will do most of our work. Copy and paste the code below into the “Console.” The code should appear right after the “&gt;.” Once it is there, hit <strong>enter</strong> to run it and see the results.</p>

## 1 FALSE      809
## 2 TRUE       500</code></pre>
<p>We got a table that counted the number of people who did and did not survive. We went from 1300 or so rows with multiple variables each to just two numbers. A pretty concise summary! But how did we do it? Let’s break down that bit of code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>titanic</code> is the name of our dataset.</li>
<li>
<code>group_by(survived)</code> tells R to group the cases in that dataset by whether they survived (<code>TRUE</code>) or not (<code>FALSE</code>).</li>
<li>
<code>summarize(n=n())</code> tells R to take our grouped cases and <em>summarize</em> them by counting the <code>n</code>umber of people in each group and labeling the resulting number “<code>n</code>.”</li>
<li>The funky symbol <code>%&gt;%</code> connects the three steps above and makes sure R does them in the order we want. This symbol is called a “pipe.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s try a few things to get a sense of why that code did what it did. What happens if we change <code>n = n()</code> in the last line to <code>Number = n()</code>?</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">titanic</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
  <span class="fu">group_by</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">survived</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
  <span class="fu">summarize</span><span class="op">(</span>Number <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">n</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre class="Rout text-muted"><code>## # A tibble: 2 × 2
##   survived Number
##   &lt;lgl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;
## 1 FALSE       809
## 2 TRUE        500</code></pre>
<p>Everything looks the same except that instead of the column being labeled “n,” it is labeled “Number.” So the bit before the equals sign is how the frequency table will be labeled.</p>
<p>Now let’s try something that seems like a small change: Instead of <code>n = n()</code> in the last line, let’s write <code>n = m()</code>. Only one letter, surely it can’t be that big of a difference?</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">titanic</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
  <span class="fu">group_by</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">survived</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
  <span class="fu">summarize</span><span class="op">(</span>n <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">m</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre class="Rout text-danger"><code>## Error: Problem with `summarise()` input `n`.
## x could not find function "m"
## ℹ Input `n` is `m()`.
## ℹ The error occurred in group 1: survived = FALSE.</code></pre>
<p>R doesn’t like it! It reports an error because it doesn’t know what to do with <code>m()</code>. That’s because <code>n()</code> is a <strong>function</strong>, it is an instruction that tells R to count the <code>n</code>umber of something. On the other hand, <code>m()</code> doesn’t mean anything to R so it throws up its hands.</p>
<p>We can also get counts based on other variables. For example, let’s ask how many passengers there were in each “class” by changing the grouping variable in our code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb19"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">titanic</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
  <span class="fu">group_by</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">class</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
  <span class="fu">summarize</span><span class="op">(</span>n <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">n</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre class="Rout text-muted"><code>## # A tibble: 3 × 2

## 1     1   323
## 2     2   277
## 3     3   709</code></pre>
<p>Since we’re on a roll, let’s see if we can count the number of passengers with or without college degrees:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">titanic</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>

  <span class="fu">summarize</span><span class="op">(</span>n <span class="op">=</span> <span class="fu">n</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre class="Rout text-danger"><code>## Error: Must group by variables found in `.data`.
## * Column `degree` is not found.</code></pre>
<p>Didn’t work! We got an error message.</p>

<p><span id="exr:unlabeled-div-2" class="exercise"><strong>Exercise 1.2  </strong></span>Explain in your own words why trying to put <code>degree</code> in the <code>group_by</code> didn’t work.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, let’s construct a frequency table using multiple variables. This lets us answer more complex questions like, <strong>how many British women were aboard the <em>Titanic</em></strong>? That question involves two variables, <code>residence</code> (where people were from) and <code>sex</code> (whether classified as male or female). We can put both of those variables in the <code>group_by</code> line to find our answer.</p>

<p>You may have heard that, when trying to evacuate the <em>Titanic</em>, there was a rule to put “women and children first” onto lifeboats. This suggests a <strong>hypothesis</strong>, assuming this rule was actually followed: female passengers should have survived more often than male passengers.</p>
<p>To see if the data are consistent with this hypothesis, we can begin by using code similar to what we’ve been using to count the number of male and female passengers who either did or did not survive.</p>

<p>While this table contains all the information we need to test this hypothesis, it is hard to read because there were different numbers of male and female passengers. What we want to know is whether a greater <em>proportion</em> of female passengers survived, compared to the <em>proportion</em> of male passengers who survived.</p>
<p>We find proportions by taking a count and dividing by a sum of counts. Specifically, if we have some group “A” and want to find the proportion of the elements in group “A” that have some characteristic “B,” we find</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Proportion of A that are B} = \frac{\text{Number of A that are B}}{\text{Total number of A's}}
\]</span>
We can do this in code by adding a line to the code we used to make our counts.</p>

<p>The new column <code>p</code> is a proportion and represents the proportion of people in each group (either male or female) who either did or did not survive. It is now easier to see that this proportion is much higher for female than male passengers, consistent with our hypothesis.</p>

<p>If we are looking for patterns or trends in data, it is often easier to see them with a visualization rather than a table of numbers. Bar charts make numerical relationships easy to see visually, so we don’t need to compare a bunch of numbers.</p>
<p>For example, above we made a table to count the number of passengers in each class. A bar chart conveys the same information in terms of the height of the bars.</p>

<p>Pretty neat! It is now easy to see how many more 3rd class passengers there were than 1st or 2nd, and that interestingly, there are fewer 2nd class than 1st class passengers.</p>
<p>The code we used is similar to what we’ve been using, but differs in some important ways:
* The first line is the same, telling R what dataset we are using (<code>titanic</code>).
* The second line tells R that we want to make a <code>plot</code> and that we want to put the variable <code>class</code> along the horizontal axis of that plot (the <code>x</code> axis). The “gg” in front of “plot” refers to the “<strong>g</strong>rammar of <strong>g</strong>raphics,” which is the language R uses to describe plots. In this language, different parts of a plot are called “<strong>aes</strong>thetics,” which is why <code>x = class</code> falls inside a parenthetical labeled <code>aes</code>(thetic).
* The final line just tells R that we want to make a <code>bar</code> chart. In the grammar of graphics, different types of charts are called <code>geom</code>s.
* Notice that the second 2 lines are connected by a <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/Arithmetic.html">+</a></code> rather than the <code>%&gt;%</code> symbol. This is a historical accident, but the meaning of the two symbols is basically the same. Both of them are telling R the order in which it should follow our instructions.</p>
<p>If we put bar charts side-by-side, we can use them to compare groups. In R, putting multiple graphs together is called <strong>faceting</strong>. Each graph is a “facet.” We can tell R to make facets based on a specific variable by adding a line to our code, like so:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb34"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">titanic</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
  <span class="fu">ggplot</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu">aes</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">class</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span>

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="01-exploring_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>The line at the end splits the plot into different “facets,” one for each level of the <code>residence</code> variable. Note that we have to put the “faceting” variable name in quotes (for some reason). The result makes it easy to see that the distribution of passengers across classes is different depending on where they were from—Americans on the <em>Titanic</em> tended to be wealthier first class passengers, relative to passengers from Britain or elsewhere.</p>

<p>So far, we have been summarizing <em>categorical</em> variables. There are also some numerical variables in our data, for example the age of each passenger as well as how much they paid for their tickets. Let’s try making a frequency table to figure out how many people of different ages sailed on the <em>Titanic</em>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb36"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

##    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
##  1 0.167     1
##  2 0.333     1
##  3 0.417     1

##  9 2        12
## 10 3         7
## # … with 89 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Well that’s not very helpful! R didn’t even bother to show us the whole thing. Though we can see something interesting: Age is measured in years, and for passengers at least one year old, their age is a whole number. But there are fractions of years for passengers less than a year old—these ages were <em>measured</em> in months rather than years.</p>
<p>The main point is that even though age can be measured in a more or less fine-grained manner, age is effectively <em>continuous</em>. We don’t want to know how many passengers were exactly 31.3491 years old, we want to get a general sense of the <em>distribution</em> of ages across passengers.</p>
<p>We can construct a summary that conveys this information using a <strong>histogram</strong>. A histogram is very similar to a bar chart; the difference is that bar charts are for categorical variables while histograms are for numerical variables. The code below constructs a histogram to summarize passenger age:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">titanic</span> <span class="op">%&gt;%</span>
  <span class="fu">ggplot</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu">aes</span><span class="op">(</span>x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">age</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span> <span class="op">+</span>
  <span class="fu">geom_histogram</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre class="Rout text-info"><code>## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.</code></pre>
<pre class="Rout text-warning"><code>## Warning: Removed 263 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).</code></pre>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="01-exploring_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png" width="672"></div>
<p>The resulting histogram shows a bunch of bars, the height of which indicate the number of passengers within a particular age range. Notice that we got a couple messages from R in addition to our plot, one about “non-finite values” and another about “picking a better value.” When R says, “non-finite values,” it is talking about people for whom their age was not recorded. This is an unfortunate thing about real data: sometimes it has missing pieces. This didn’t stop R from making the plot we wanted using the non-missing data, but R wanted to warn us just in case.</p>
<p>The message about “picking a better value” is important: When you make a histogram, you are looking at how many things fall within a particular range of values, say, between ages 4 and 8. How do you decide those ranges? If you don’t tell R how to do that, it will decide on its own to divide up the range of values into 30 “bins,” each of which corresponds to a range of values that is the same width. This is usually not what we want.</p>
<p>Instead, we should decide how big or small we want those ranges to be. The following code tells R to make our histogram using “bins” that are 2 years “wide” (0-1, 2-3, etc.):</p>

<p>Today we began our adventure by using RStudio to explore some data. We saw how to look at data and how to summarize it in various helpful ways. These were frequency tables, bar charts, and histograms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequency tables count the number of times a particular value of a particular variable (or combination of values across multiple variables) occurs in our dataset.</li>
<li>We can use the counts in frequency tables to calculate proportions, which are better at conveying relative values.</li>
<li>Bar charts display counts of categorical variables in a visual form that makes it easier to compare them.</li>
<li>Histograms let us visually summarize counts of numerical variables by putting them in “bins,” the width of which we need to decide.</li>
